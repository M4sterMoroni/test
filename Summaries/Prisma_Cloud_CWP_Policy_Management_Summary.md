## Policy Types in Prisma Cloud CWP

### **1. Vulnerability Policies**
Vulnerability policies help identify and manage security vulnerabilities in your container images, hosts, and applications.

#### **Key Components:**
- **CVE Detection**: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identification
- **Base Image Analysis**: Vulnerability scanning in container base images
- **Package Dependencies**: Software vulnerability assessment
- **Runtime Vulnerabilities**: Application security testing
- **Severity Classification**: Critical, High, Medium, Low risk levels

#### **Policy Configuration:**
```yaml
# Example Vulnerability Policy
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: vulnerability-policy
data:
  policy.yaml: |
    vulnerability:
      enabled: true
      scanOnPush: true
      scanOnPull: false
      severityThresholds:
        critical: 0
        high: 5
        medium: 10
        low: 20
      exclusions:
        - cve: "CVE-2021-1234"
        - package: "legacy-package"
      autoRemediation:
        enabled: true
        maxSeverity: "medium"
```

### **2. Compliance Policies**
Compliance policies ensure adherence to security standards and regulatory requirements.

#### **Supported Frameworks:**
- **CIS Benchmarks**: Center for Internet Security standards
- **NIST**: National Institute of Standards and Technology
- **PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
- **SOC 2**: Service Organization Control 2
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation

#### **Policy Structure:**
```yaml
# Example Compliance Policy
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: compliance-policy
data:
  policy.yaml: |
    compliance:
      frameworks:
        - name: "CIS Kubernetes"
          version: "1.6"
          enabled: true
        - name: "NIST"
          version: "800-53"
          enabled: true
      rules:
        - id: "CIS-1.1.1"
          severity: "high"
          remediation: "Ensure that the API server pod specification file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive"
        - id: "NIST-AC-3"
          severity: "medium"
          remediation: "Implement access control mechanisms"
```

### **3. Runtime Policies**
Runtime policies monitor and control application behavior during execution.

#### **Categories:**
- **Network Policies**: Traffic flow control and monitoring
- **File System Policies**: File access and modification controls
- **Process Policies**: Process execution and privilege controls
- **System Call Policies**: Kernel-level system call monitoring

### **4. Admission Control Policies**
Admission control policies prevent non-compliant workloads from being deployed.

#### **Types:**
- **Image Scanning**: Block deployment of vulnerable images
- **Resource Limits**: Enforce resource constraints
- **Security Context**: Validate security configurations
- **Network Policies**: Ensure network security compliance
